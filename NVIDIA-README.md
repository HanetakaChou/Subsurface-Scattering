Overview
--------

FaceWorks is a middleware library for high-quality skin and eye rendering, inspired by the techniques used in NVIDIA's ["Digital Ira" demo](http://www.nvidia.com/coolstuff/demos#!/lifelike-human-face-rendering).

Digital Ira is a tech demo, created by NVIDIA in collaboration with Dr. Paul Debevec's team at USC, in which a high-resolution head scan and performance capture are rendered as realistically as possible in real-time, using every rendering technique the demo team could think of. FaceWorks, in contrast, aims to be a reusable, production-ready library, with the goal of enabling game developers to match the rendering quality of Digital Ira.

FaceWorks currently provides two main features:

-   A high-quality, efficient subsurface scattering solution, which supports both direct and ambient light.
-   An implementation of deep scattering (translucency) for direct light, based on estimating thickness from a shadow map.

Currently, Direct3D 11 is the only API supported by FaceWorks.

### Subsurface Scattering

![Comparison of rendering a human face with and without subsurface scattering ([Larger version](doc/images/sss_comparison_large.png))](doc/images/sss_comparison.png)

Subsurface scattering (SSS) is a physical process in which light penetrates into the skin, bounces around and exits at a different point; it's a critical part of the appearance of realistic human skin, since without it, skin looks unnaturally hard and dry, as seen in the screenshots above.

FaceWorks includes an implementation of SSS based on Eric Penner's 2010 SIGGRAPH paper, [Pre-Integrated Skin Shading](http://advances.realtimerendering.com/s2011/Penner%20-%20Pre-Integrated%20Skin%20Rendering%20%28Siggraph%202011%20Advances%20in%20Real-Time%20Rendering%20Course%29.pptx). This has the advantage of requiring only a single rendering pass, which makes it both more efficient than multi-pass methods like texture-space diffusion, and also easier to integrate into a game engine.

In addition, FaceWorks supports SSS for ambient light as well as direct light. Ambient light can be implemented using spherical harmonics, image-based lighting, or any other method; the only requirement is that you be able to evaluate it for different normal vectors in the pixel shader.

Our implementation of SSS is broken down into four components:

**Curvature:** we precompute per-vertex curvature values for each mesh that will have FaceWorks rendering applied. SSS is more apparent in regions of the mesh with greater curvature. In the pixel shader, the curvature and N·L at each point are used to sample a lookup texture (LUT) storing precomputed scattering results.

**Normal maps<!--- -->:** we sample the normal map twice, once as usual and once with a higher mip level, to get a blurred normal corresponding to the SSS radius. The lighting from both normals is combined with the curvature term to arrive at the total diffuse lighting. In order to calculate the correct mip level, FaceWorks also needs to know the UV scale, which we precompute per mesh.

**Shadow edges:** light diffuses from lit areas into shadows, producing a red glow inside the shadow edge. The trick to this is to use a wide shadow filter, then sharpen up the shadows and use the remaining value range to add that red glow. We leave the details of shadow filtering up to you; you can use any method as long as it gives a consistent filter radius (as seen from the light source). Contact-hardening methods are not desirable here.

Given that wide shadow filter value, FaceWorks uses it to sample another LUT storing precomputed scattering results, and this gives the final shadow color.

In principle, the shadow filter width (i.e. the distance over which the shadow value goes from 0 to 1 when crossing a shadow edge, on a surface directly facing the light source) should be at least as wide as the SSS diffusion filter. Note that the radius set in various FaceWorks configuration structs is the sigma of the widest Gaussian in the diffusion profile, so the total filter width is about 6 times larger. For human skin, the diffusion radius is 2.7 mm, so the shadow filter width should ideally be at least 16.2 mm.

However, such a large shadow filter may be impractical for both performance and aesthetic reasons. If you use a narrower filter, the light won’t bleed as far across shadow edges as it physically should, but the SSS result calculated by FaceWorks will still have a smooth falloff and look visually convincing.

**Ambient light:** as mentioned earlier, you can use any type of ambient lighting as long as you can evaluate it for multiple normal vectors. FaceWorks uses the two normal vectors seen previously as well as a third, intermediate normal; ambient light is evaluated for each of these normals, then the three lighting values are combined back together into one.

FaceWorks will evaluate the lighting due to each of these components; you can then multiply the result by the diffuse color and light color, just like the usual diffuse lighting term, and add a specular model of your choice.

### Deep Scatter

![Comparison of rendering a human face with and without deep scatter ([Larger version](doc/images/deep_scatter_comparison_large.png))](doc/images/deep_scatter_comparison.png)

While SSS models the diffusion of light locally along the surface of the skin, light can also scatter through the bulk of a model in thin areas such as the nose and ears. This produces the red glow seen in these areas when backlit, as in the screenshots above. In FaceWorks we call this process "deep scatter".

FaceWorks implements deep scatter by estimating the distance light would have to travel through an object, using the shadow map; then a falloff function is applied based on that distance. It can work with your existing shadow maps, so no additional rendering passes are needed.

We provide helper functions to estimate thickness from the shadow map in common cases. Standard depth maps with either ortho or perspective projections. However, if you're using some other shadow format, such as VSM or ESM, then you'll have to write your own code for thickness estimation.

We recommend applying an inward normal offset to the shadow sampling position, to help avoid silhouette edge issues, and also applying a wide filter, such as a Poisson disk filter, to soften the resulting thickness values.

Given the thickness, FaceWorks applies a falloff function based on the thickness and N·L. The result should be multiplied by the diffuse color and light color, just like the usual diffuse lighting term. You can also multiply the deep scatter result by a texture to control the scattering color, and represent details like veins and bones under the skin surface.

### Future Features

Additional rendering features planned for future versions of FaceWorks include:

-   An extension to deep scatter to support ambient light as well as direct.
-   A customized specular model for human skin.
-   Features to support realistic eye lighting, including reflection and refraction effects.
-   Customizable diffusion profiles. Currently, the human skin diffusion profile is hard-coded into FaceWorks; however, we'd like to make this customizable, so that other materials such as creature skin, cloth, paper, wax, etc. can be simulated.
-   Support for additional graphics APIs and platforms, including OpenGL, mobile, and consoles.

Integration Guide
-----------------

To integrate FaceWorks into your game engine, there are three main tasks you'll have to accomplish:

-   In your art pipeline, you'll need to generate the various precomputed data mentioned in the feature-overview. The FaceWorks C API and DLL contain the routines for building this data.
-   Your game engine will need to use the FaceWorks runtime API to calculate the constant buffer data used by the pixel shaders. This is also done by a C API in the FaceWorks DLL. You'll need to include this data in one of your constant buffers, and also expose the LUTs to the shader.
-   In pixel shaders where you want to use FaceWorks, you'll need to `#include` the FaceWorks HLSL API, which is a blob of code that gets compiled into your shaders. It contains the routines to access all the data that's been set up and evaluate the lighting equations.

The following sections discuss each of these tasks in detail.

### Initialization

Before using any FaceWorks functions, you'll need to call `GFSDK_FaceWorks_Init()`. This sets up the internal state of the library and sanity-checks that the version numbers of the header and DLL match.

### Precomputed Data

The precomputed data used by FaceWorks falls into two categories:

-   Data about the geometry of meshes that will be rendered with FaceWorks
-   Two global lookup textures storing precomputed scattering results

#### Mesh Data

As input to its SSS calculations, FaceWorks uses per-vertex curvature and per-mesh UV scale data.

The `GFSDK_FaceWorks_CalculateMeshCurvature()` function can be used to calculate the curvature values. This function takes the mesh vertex positions and normals, as arrays of floats, as well as the mesh's triangle indices. It estimates the curvature around each vertex, then optionally applies one or more smoothing passes to reduce noise (we use two passes in the sample app). The resulting curvatures are then stored to an output array, one float per vertex. You'll need to store the curvatures in a vertex buffer, and make the interpolated curvature available in pixel shaders where FaceWorks is to be used.

(Note that in principle, curvature values should change if a mesh animates or deforms; however, in FaceWorks we don't currently provide any support to animate curvature values in real-time. In practice, we suspect it's difficult to notice the effect of changing curvature in common cases, so we recommend simply calculating curvature for the bind pose of a mesh.)

In addition to curvature, FaceWorks uses a per-mesh average UV scale to calibrate the mip level for sampling the normal map. The `GFSDK_FaceWorks_CalculateMeshUVScale()` function can be used to calculate the average UV scale, one float per mesh. You should store this data alongside the mesh somewhere, then later communicate it to the FaceWorks runtime API via a configuration struct (see the-runtime-api).

Curvature has units of inverse length, and UV scale has units of length; therefore, if a mesh is scaled at runtime, you should multiply the UV scale by the same scale factor used for the mesh, and divide all the curvature values by that factor.

NB: it doesn't matter what units are used for vertex positions, as long as the same units are applied consistently throughout all your interactions with FaceWorks. The length values used for computing curvature, building the LUTs, in the runtime configuration structs, and in the pixel shader should all be expressed in the same units.

#### Lookup Textures

FaceWorks also depends on two lookup textures, one related to curvature and one to shadows. These textures are not specific to a mesh; you can most likely generate them once and import them into your engine as regular RGB textures, to be re-used across all meshes rendered with FaceWorks.

In the `samples/lut_generator` directory in the FaceWorks repository, there is a utility for generating these LUTs and saving them out as .bmp files. You can also generate the LUTs programmatically using the `GFSDK_FaceWorks_GenerateCurvatureLUT()` and `GFSDK_FaceWorks_GenerateShadowLUT()` functions. Each of these functions accepts a configuration struct detailing the parameters to the generation process.

The members of `GFSDK_FaceWorks_CurvatureLUTConfig` are as follows:

-   `m_diffusionRadius` the desired diffusion radius, in world units. NB: this is the sigma of the widest Gaussian in the diffusion profile, which is 2.7 mm for human skin.
-   `m_texWidth`, `m_texHeight` the desired texture dimensions in pixels.
-   `m_curvatureRadiusMin`, `m_curvatureRadiusMax` the desired min/max radius of curvature to be represented in the texture. Set these to a range that encompasses the typical range of curvatures found in your models. For human faces, 0.1 cm to 10 cm is a good choice. Note that the minimum radius cannot be zero (as this would correspond to infinite curvature it's a bit like the near plane of a perspective projection).

The members of `GFSDK_FaceWorks_ShadowLUTConfig` are very similar:

-   `m_diffusionRadius` the desired diffusion radius, in world units.
-   `m_texWidth`, `m_texHeight` the desired texture dimensions in pixels.
-   `m_shadowWidthMin`, `m_shadowWidthMax` the desired min/max shadow filter width to be represented in the texture. By filter width, we mean the distance (in world units) over which the shadow filter will go from 0 to 1 when crossing a shadow edge. The minimum width cannot be zero.
-   `m_shadowSharpening` the ratio by which the output shadow is sharpened. In other words, if this is set to 10, we'll simulate a shadow filter 10x less wide than the real one, and the other 90% of the filter width is available to simulate SSS.

Both textures are generated in RGBA8 format, in left-to-right top-to-bottom pixel order. The caller is responsible for allocating sufficient memory to hold the output; the required size can be calculated by calling `GFSDK_FaceWorks_CalculateCurvatureLUTSizeBytes()` and `GFSDK_FaceWorks_CalculateShadowLUTSizeBytes()`.

Note that if the application tries to use curvatures or shadow widths outside of the ranges represented in the textures, we will simply clamp to the edge of the textures; the results will remain plausible as long as you're not too far outside the range.

In the sample app, we used 512x512 LUTs, stored in uncompressed RGBA8. Smaller resolutions can also be used if desired. If compression is necessary, we suggest trying BC6, BC7, or YCoCg in DXT5; DXT1 isn't recommended, since it will create a great deal of banding in the smooth gradients.

It's important to note that the curvature LUT is generated in linear RGB color space, while the shadow LUT is generated in sRGB color space. FaceWorks expects their texture formats to reflect this, i.e. the curvature LUT should be in a `UNORM` format and the shadow LUT in a `UNORM_SRGB` format. The FaceWorks runtime API will check for this and issue warnings if the shader resource views are not in the expected formats.

### The Runtime API

Before doing a draw call that uses FaceWorks, you'll need to set up the graphics state needed by the FaceWorks pixel shader API. This consists of per-material constant buffer data, as well as the two LUTs used for SSS.

For material data, FaceWorks provides an HLSL struct, `GFSDK_FaceWorks_CBData`, which you can incorporate in one of your constant buffers. This struct has a fixed size and contains the data for both SSS and deep scatter. It can be generated by filling out a configuration struct and calling the corresponding `WriteCBData` function (one each for SSS and deep scatter).

You'll also need to make the two LUTs available to the pixel shader, as well as an appropriate sampler; the LUTs should be sampled with bilinear filtering and clamp addressing.

#### CB Data For SSS

Constant buffer data related to SSS can be generated by filling out a `GFSDK_FaceWorks_SSSConfig` struct, then calling `GFSDK_FaceWorks_WriteCBDataForSSS()`. The members of `GFSDK_FaceWorks_SSSConfig` are as follows:

-   `m_diffusionRadius` the desired diffusion radius, in world units.
-   `m_diffusionRadiusLUT` the diffusion radius used to build the LUTs. Separating this parameter from the previous one allows the diffusion radius to be varied at runtime, without rebuilding the LUTs. FaceWorks will automatically make the necessary adjustments in the lighting equations.
-   `m_curvatureRadiusMinLUT`, `m_curvatureRadiusMaxLUT` min/max curvature values used to build the curvature LUT (should match the values set in `GFSDK_FaceWorks_CurvatureLUTConfig`).
-   `m_shadowWidthMinLUT`, `m_shadowWidthMaxLUT` min/max shadow width values used to build the shadow LUT (should match the values set in `GFSDK_FaceWorks_ShadowLUTConfig`).
-   `m_shadowFilterWidth` world-space width of the shadow filter, on a surface directly facing the light source. In other words, the distance over which the shadow value goes from 0 to 1 when crossing a shadow edge.
-   `m_normalMapSize` pixel resolution of the normal map (used to calculate the mip level for the blurred normal sample, as mentioned in the feature-overview). If its width and height differ, use the average of the two.
-   `m_averageUVScale` average UV scale of the mesh, as computed by `GFSDK_FaceWorks_CalculateMeshUVScale()`.

#### CB Data For Deep Scatter

Constant buffer data related to deep scatter can be set by filling out a `GFSDK_FaceWorks_DeepScatterConfig` struct, then calling `GFSDK_FaceWorks_WriteCBDataForDeepScatter()`. The members of `GFSDK_FaceWorks_DeepScatterConfig` are as follows:

-   `m_radius` the desired deep scatter radius, in world units. In other words, the distance light can penetrate through the model. This is used as a Gaussian sigma. In principle, this value should equal the diffusion radius used for SSS, but in practice it's often more aesthetically pleasing to set this to a larger radius, such as 5--6 mm.
-   `m_shadowProjType` the type of projection matrix used for the shadow map. This, and the next two members, are only needed if you're using the FaceWorks helper functions for estimating thickness from the shadow map. Set to `GFSDK_FaceWorks_NoProjection` if you're doing the thickness estimate yourself.
-   `m_shadowProjMatrix` the shadow map projection matrix, stored in row-major order and assuming a row-vector math convention; transpose your matrix if you're using different conventions.
-   `m_shadowFilterRadius` the desired filter radius for the thickness estimate, expressed as a distance in shadow map UV space.

### In The Pixel Shader

Pixel shaders making use of FaceWorks have many responsibilities, and there's a fairly intricate chain of control leading back and forth between your code and FaceWorks code in order to make use of all the features. The shader needs to do the following.

For basic diffuse lighting:

-   The interpolated per-vertex curvature needs to be available in the pixel shader.
-   Sample the normal map twice, once as usual and once with a higher mip level calculated by FaceWorks.
-   Call FaceWorks to evaluate the direct diffuse lighting term using the two normals and the curvature.

For shadows:

-   Evaluate shadows using a wide filter.
-   Call FaceWorks to evaluate the shadow SSS term using the wide shadow result.

For ambient lighting:

-   Call FaceWorks to generate the three normals to use to evaluate ambient light.
-   Evaluate ambient light at those three normals.
-   Call FaceWorks to combine those three lighting values to get the ambient diffuse lighting term.

For deep scatter:

-   Estimate the thickness from the shadow map, using either a FaceWorks helper function, or your own code.
-   Call FaceWorks to evaluate the deep scatter lighting term using the thickness.
-   Add up all the terms, factor in the diffuse color and light color where needed, and add specular.

The following sections discuss these steps in detail.

#### Normals and Curvature

First, to determine the mip level at which to sample the normal map, you can call `GFSDK_FaceWorks_CalculateMipLevelForBlurredNormal()`. This function accepts:

-   The `GFSDK_FaceWorks_CBData` struct passed down in a constant buffer
-   The texture, sampler, and UV at which to calculate the mip level

(Note that this function doesn't do any texture sampling itself, just calls D3D11's `CalculateLevelOfDetail()` method.)

Sample the normal map twice, once as usual and once with the resulting mip level. Unpack both normals, convert them from tangent to world space, etc. just as you usually would.

To calculate direct diffuse lighting, call `GFSDK_FaceWorks_EvaluateSSSDirectLight()`. This function accepts:

-   The `GFSDK_FaceWorks_CBData` struct passed down in a constant buffer
-   The geometric normal (i.e. interpolated vertex normal)
-   The shading normal from the normal map
-   The blurred normal, from the normal map with the higher-mip sample
-   The unit vector from the shaded point toward the light source
-   The curvature value interpolated from the vertices
-   The texture and sampler objects for the curvature LUT

It doesn't matter what space the vectors are in (view, world, local, tangent, etc.), as long as they're all in the same space.

The result is the RGB diffuse lighting term, ready to be multiplied by the diffuse color, light color, and shadow term just as you would normally do. In other words, it replaces the `saturate(dot(N, L))` factor in standard diffuse lighting.

This function can be called several times to calculate results for different light sources, if necessary.

#### Shadows

As mentioned in the feature-overview, the details of shadow filtering are up to you; FaceWorks does not do the actual filtering for you.

Once you have the wide shadow filter value, call `GFSDK_FaceWorks_EvaluateSSSShadow()`. This function accepts:

-   The `GFSDK_FaceWorks_CBData` struct passed down in a constant buffer
-   The geometric normal (i.e. interpolated vertex normal)
-   The unit vector from the shaded point toward the light source
-   The shadow value (0 = fully in shadow, 1 = fully lit)
-   The texture and sampler objects for the shadow LUT

The result is the RGB shadow color, including both the sharpened version of the input shadow as well as the red glow inside the shadow edge due to SSS. This can be multiplied by the result from `GFSDK_FaceWorks_EvaluateSSSDirectLight()`, the diffuse color and the light color.

Additionally, you will likely want to use the sharpened version of the input shadow for specular and other lighting terms, so that they'll match the SSS diffuse term. You can call `GFSDK_FaceWorks_SharpenShadow()` to quickly calculate this; it accepts the input shadow value as well as the sharpening factor (the same value used when generating the shadow LUT; see lookup-textures).

#### Ambient Light

To generate the three normal vectors used for ambient light, call `GFSDK_FaceWorks_CalculateNormalsForAmbientLight()`. This function accepts the shading normal and blurred normal seen previously, and returns (via output parameters) the three normals at which to evaluate ambient light.

You can then evaluate the ambient light coming from each of those three normals, and pass the RGB results to `GFSDK_FaceWorks_EvaluateSSSAmbientLight()`. The result will be the RGB ambient lighting result, ready to be multiplied by the diffuse color.

#### Deep Scatter

The FaceWorks helper functions for evaluating the shadow map thickness are as follows:

-   `GFSDK_FaceWorks_EstimateThicknessFromParallelShadowPoisson8()`
-   `GFSDK_FaceWorks_EstimateThicknessFromPerspectiveShadowPoisson8()`
-   `GFSDK_FaceWorks_EstimateThicknessFromParallelShadowPoisson32()`
-   `GFSDK_FaceWorks_EstimateThicknessFromPerspectiveShadowPoisson32()`

These handle the cases of a standard depth map with either parallel or perspective projection, using either 8 or 32 Poisson disk taps. In order to use these functions, shadow map information must have been provided to FaceWorks in the `GFSDK_FaceWorks_DeepScatterConfig` struct (see cb-data-deep-scatter). Each of these functions accepts:

-   The `GFSDK_FaceWorks_CBData` struct passed down in a constant buffer
-   The depth texture and sampler to use
-   The UVZ coordinates in \[0, 1] at which to sample

The functions all return the thickness in world units.

Note that these functions do not include the inward normal offset to the shadow sampling position that we recommended in the feature-overview. You'll need to apply this offset to the position yourself. The sample app included with FaceWorks demonstrates this.

Whether you use these helper functions or your own thickness estimate, you can pass the result to `GFSDK_FaceWorks_EvaluateDeepScatterDirectLight()`. This function accepts:

-   The `GFSDK_FaceWorks_CBData` struct passed down in a constant buffer
-   The blurred normal seen previously
-   The unit vector from the shaded point toward the light source
-   The thickness value, in world units

It returns the scalar intensity of deep scatter, which you can multiply by the desired deep scatter color (e.g. a deep red for human skin, possibly modulated by a texture to represent under-skin details like veins and bones), the diffuse color, and the light color.

### Error Handling

Most FaceWorks functions return a `GFSDK_FaceWorks_Result` code, which is either `GFSDK_FaceWorks_OK` or an error code that coarsely indicates what went wrong.

For more detail, FaceWorks returns verbose error messages using the `GFSDK_FaceWorks_ErrorBlob` struct, which encapsulates a message string. If you create one of these structs and pass it in to FaceWorks functions that accept it, we will allocate the memory and append errors and warnings to it as necessary. You can then display or log the message string as desired.

When you're done with the error blob, call `GFSDK_FaceWorks_FreeErrorBlob()` to free the memory. You can also provide allocator callbacks via the `m_allocator` member of the error blob, in which case FaceWorks will use that allocator for the message string memory.
